Freeze
------

A simple Bukkit plugin to perform mass operations on the whitelist.

Currently the plugin is designed to compile and run with bukkit-1.6.4-R2.0.
Using a different version may cause it to malfunction.

Building
--------

1. Download Bukkit from http://dl.bukkit.org/downloads/bukkit/list/rb/.
   (Use 1.6.4-R2.0 for best compatibility! - The project should still work with builds going back at least to minecraft version 1.2.5)

2. Move your download of bukkit to lib/bukkit.jar or create a link in lib called bukkit.jar that points to your copy of bukkit.

2. cd to the project directory.

3. Type 'make' to build the plugin.


Installation
------------

1. Move 'Freeze.jar' from the bin directory into the plugins folder of your bukkit server.


Command Usage
-------------

Arguments:

**e**  Make sure the whitelist is enabled. If it is off, turn it on, then proceed to add players as normal.

**c** Clears the whitelist.

Examples:
